### CO2 Emissions & Loans Analysis Projects
## Overview
This repository contains two separate projects that focus on analyzing data using Excel:

CO2 Emissions Analysis Project: This project focuses on examining global CO2 emissions data and identifying trends based on country and year.

Loans Analysis Project: This project explores various factors influencing loan approvals, such as applicant income, loan amount, and credit history, using data analysis in Excel.

### CO2 Emissions Analysis Project
## Project Description
The CO2 Emissions Analysis Project aims to explore global CO2 emissions over time. Using Excel, the data has been cleaned, processed, and analyzed to identify key trends and patterns. The project provides insights into the emissions of various countries and regions, allowing for a clear understanding of how emissions have changed over time.

## Key Features
Data Cleaning: The raw CO2 emissions data was cleaned and prepared in Excel.
Data Analysis: Excel pivot tables and formulas were used to explore year-over-year changes in emissions.
Visualizations: Line charts and bar charts were created in Excel to visualize emission trends by country and year.
## Key Findings
Developing nations have seen a rapid rise in CO2 emissions, while emissions in some developed countries have plateaued or declined in recent years.


### Loans Analysis Project
## Project Description
The Loans Analysis Project analyzes loan application data to determine the factors that affect loan approval decisions. The data is processed in Excel, with the use of pivot tables, charts, and filters to explore relationships between variables like income, loan amount, and credit history.

## Key Features
Data Cleaning: Loan data was cleaned to remove inconsistencies and missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Pivot tables and charts in Excel were used to analyze loan approval rates and factors such as applicant income and credit history.
Visualizations: Bar charts and pie charts were created to illustrate loan approval trends, income distributions, and more.
## Key Findings
Higher income and a positive credit history are strongly correlated with higher loan approval rates.
